                The theory of the cosmos integrates various disciplines, 
                including astronomy, physics, philosophy, and metaphysics.
                 The following is an overview of different theories related to the cosmos:

            <h2>Big Bang Theory</h2>
            <p>
                This is the most recent theory explaining the origin
                 and evolution of the universe. The Big Bang theory 
                 suggests that the history of the universe began with 
                 the Big Bang around 13.8 billion years ago. 
                 As a result of the Big Bang, time, space, 
                 and all matter were created, leading to the expansion of the cosmos.

            <h2>Black Hole Theory</h2>
                <p>
                    Black holes form from the collapse of very massive stars. 
                    These are regions where gravity is so intense that nothing, 
                    not even light, can escape. Black holes interact with nearby 
                    matter and can emit radiation.

                    String theory is one approach that seeks a unified description 
                    of the physical world. According to this theory, we live in a 
                    three-dimensional space on Earth, but the cosmos might contain 
                    additional microscopic, non-material "strings" (vibrating filaments)
                    that are part of confined spaces with different sizes and 
                    characteristics.

            <p>Here are three key points about String Theory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><img src="./img/Rectangle 2332.svg"/>
                        Unified Description of the Universe: String theory seeks 
                        to provide a single framework that explains all fundamental 
                        forces and particles in the universe, including gravity, 
                        electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. 
                    </li>
                    <li><img src="./img/Rectangle 2332.svg"/>
                        Extra Dimensions: While we experience a three-dimensional 
                        space, string theory proposes the existence of additional 
                        microscopic dimensions that are compactified, potentially 
                        influencing the laws of physics.
                    </li>
                    <li><img src="./img/Rectangle 2332.svg"/>
                        Vibrating Strings: According to string theory, 
                        the fundamental building blocks of matter are not 
                        point-like particles but rather one-dimensional 
                        "strings" that vibrate at different frequencies,
                        with each vibration corresponding to a different
                        particle type.
